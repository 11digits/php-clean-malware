# php-clean-malware
Simple PHP code to assist in cleaning of injected malware PHP code

Use at your own risk. I advise to run it first without the --fix param to check the files

The code is buggy and subject to change in later versions.


USAGE: 

php pcm.php [PATH RELATIVE TO CURRENT FOLDER OR ABSOLUTE] [--auto|--signature] [--fix]

--auto: will search for code with the auto check, this will improve for the future
--signature: will search for code based on the .sig files in the signatures folder



What it does:

It finds all the PHP files in the given folder and replaced the malware code with "" (blank)
